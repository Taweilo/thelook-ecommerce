The Elbow Method is a technique used in clustering analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. It is based on the concept that as the number of clusters increases, the within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) decreases. <br><br>

**Within-cluster Sum of Squares (WSS)** :

$$
WSS = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - c_i||^2
$$

where:
- $K$ is the number of clusters.
- $C_i$ is the i-th cluster.
- $x$ is a data point in cluster $C_i$.
- $c_i$ is the centroid of cluster $C_i$.
- $||x - c_i||$ represents the Euclidean distance between data point x and its cluster centroid $c_i$.

The WSS is a measure of how compact the clusters are, with lower WSS values indicating tighter clusters and better overall clustering.

The final forecast in Prophet is composed additively, combining different components:

$$
 y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + e(t) 
$$

Where:
- $y(t)$ is the forecasted value at time $t$.
- $g(t)$ represents the trend component.
- $s(t)$ represents the seasonal component.
- $h(t)$ represents the holiday effect component.
- $e(t)$ represents the residual component, capturing uncertainty or unexplained variations.

This additive composition allows Prophet to model complex time series patterns by combining trends, seasonalities, holiday effects, and residual fluctuations.

## 4. Limitations & future prospective
- Database design: some features are repetitive in different tables
- Database feature: more information should be incorporated
- Assumptions: synthetic data makes the data value dynamic
- Business value: lack of insider information to customize the business value
- Data model: for the time series model a more complex model can be developed to describe the pattern well
  
## 5. Recommendations
- Leveraged CRM monthly reports can identify the performance with ease
- RFM analysis benefits the customized marketing plan effectively and the matrics can be updated
- The location of distribution centers deserves to be reviewed and incorporated more business insider information to calculate the business value
